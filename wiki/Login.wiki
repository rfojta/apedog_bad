Explanation of how login in apedog works


= Details =

*Succesful use case:* User wants is accessing apedog. If last user session is still alive it will redirect him to main_page.php.
If there is no session set, user gets to index.php which is page with neutral template and possibility of login. User inserts username and password, if those match with one of $USERS array defined in index.php session is set and user is redirected to the main_page.php. After user finishes work, he logs out, the session is terminated and user is redirected to the index.php

Everytime user want to access some inner page of a system there is a check if session with user is set, if not, user is redirected to index.php

Based on the inserted username, picture in the top menu is chosen.

Useful links are accessible either logged in or logged out - top menu of the page is depending on that.
